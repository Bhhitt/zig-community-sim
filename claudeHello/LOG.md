# Development Log

## Initial Project Setup and Fixes
- Fixed build.zig to use `.cwd_relative` instead of `.path` for Zig 0.14.0 compatibility
- Fixed syntax in agent.zig by adding proper braces around switch case statements
- Changed `var terrain` to `const terrain` in map.zig as the variable wasn't being mutated
- Verified build and run functionality

## Added Unit Tests
- Created test files for all major components (agent_test.zig, map_test.zig, simulation_test.zig)
- Implemented tests for agent creation, symbol mapping, and movement
- Implemented tests for map initialization, terrain access, and manipulation
- Implemented tests for simulation initialization, agent spawning, and updating

## Improved Agent Movement with Brownian Motion
- Replaced simple directional movement with Brownian motion for more natural random walks
- Implemented different energy costs based on agent type (Explorers move efficiently, Builders less so)
- Added proper boundary checking for movement

## Added Agent Interactions
- Implemented interaction system between nearby agents
- Created three interaction types: Greeting, Trading, and Collaboration
- Added interaction duration and automatic expiration
- Different agent types prefer different interaction types
- Enhanced map display to show active interactions
- Agents don't move while interacting with each other
- Updated file saving to include interaction data

## Compatibility Fixes
- Adjusted code to work with Zig 0.14.0
- Fixed random number generation to use simpler timestamp-based approach
- Modified symbols to use ASCII characters for compatibility
- Optimized file and interaction display

## Experimental SDL3 Graphical Visualization
- Created rendering module (`renderer.zig`) with SDL3 integration framework
- Prepared groundwork for graphical output when SDL3 is properly configured
- Currently using ASCII-only mode for maximum compatibility
- Implemented color-coded terrain rendering with grid layout
- Added circular agent representation with different colors by type
- Implemented energy indicator bars for each agent
- Added interaction visualization with connecting lines
- Maintained original ASCII output alongside graphical display
- Added configuration to switch between ASCII-only and SDL mode
- Added frame delay to control simulation speed
- Implemented input handling for exit conditions (ESC key and window close)

## Agent Randomness and Multi-threading Improvements
- Added individual random seeds for each agent to ensure unique movement patterns
- Prevented shared timestamp issues when adding new agents at the same time
- Enhanced random movement by mixing agent ID, seed, and timestamp
- Implemented multi-threaded agent updates using Zig's standard thread API
- Added mutex-protected access to interactions data for thread safety
- Created dynamic thread allocation based on agent count
- Added adaptive threading that falls back to single-threaded mode for small agent counts
- Implemented batch processing of agents across multiple threads
- Enhanced test suite to verify multi-threaded functionality

## Summary
The community simulation now features:
- Multiple agent types (Settler, Explorer, Builder) with different movement efficiency
- Random movement with boundary checks and unique patterns per agent
- Social interactions between nearby agents
- Visualization of agent positions and active interactions
- Dual visualization modes: ASCII terminal output and SDL2 graphical rendering
- Saving simulation state to file
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Configurable simulation speed and display options
- Multi-threaded agent processing for improved performance with large numbers of agents

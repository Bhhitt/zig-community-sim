# Development Log

## Initial Project Setup and Fixes
- Fixed build.zig to use `.cwd_relative` instead of `.path` for Zig 0.14.0 compatibility
- Fixed syntax in agent.zig by adding proper braces around switch case statements
- Changed `var terrain` to `const terrain` in map.zig as the variable wasn't being mutated
- Verified build and run functionality

## Added Unit Tests
- Created test files for all major components (agent_test.zig, map_test.zig, simulation_test.zig)
- Implemented tests for agent creation, symbol mapping, and movement
- Implemented tests for map initialization, terrain access, and manipulation
- Implemented tests for simulation initialization, agent spawning, and updating

## Improved Agent Movement with Brownian Motion
- Replaced simple directional movement with Brownian motion for more natural random walks
- Implemented different energy costs based on agent type (Explorers move efficiently, Builders less so)
- Added proper boundary checking for movement

## Added Agent Interactions
- Implemented interaction system between nearby agents
- Created five interaction types: Greeting, Trading, Collaboration, Teaching, and Resource
- Added interaction duration and automatic expiration
- Different agent types prefer different interaction types
- Enhanced map display to show active interactions
- Agents don't move while interacting with each other
- Updated file saving to include interaction data

## Expanded Agent Types and Behaviors
- Added three new agent types: Farmer, Miner, and Scout
- Each agent type has unique movement patterns and energy costs
- Implemented agent-specific interaction preferences
- Different agent types have different health and energy distributions
- Agents interact differently with terrain based on their type
- Enhanced visualization with unique symbols and colors for each agent type

## Compatibility Fixes
- Adjusted code to work with Zig 0.14.0
- Fixed random number generation to use simpler timestamp-based approach
- Modified symbols to use ASCII characters for compatibility
- Optimized file and interaction display

## SDL3 Graphical Visualization
- Created renderer.zig with SDL3 integration
- Implemented color-coded terrain rendering with grid layout
- Added circular agent representation with different colors by type
- Implemented energy indicator bars for each agent
- Added interaction visualization with connecting lines
- Maintained original ASCII output alongside graphical display
- Added configuration to switch between ASCII-only and SDL mode
- Added frame delay to control simulation speed
- Implemented input handling (pause, step, spawn, agent selection, exit)
- Added spawn mode allowing user to place agents with mouse clicks
- Enhanced visualization with agent-type selection controls

## Multi-threading and Performance Improvements
- Implemented multi-threaded agent updates using Zig's standard thread API
- Added mutex-protected access to interactions data for thread safety
- Created dynamic thread allocation based on agent count
- Added adaptive threading that falls back to single-threaded mode for small agent counts
- Implemented batch processing of agents across multiple threads
- Enhanced test suite to verify multi-threaded functionality
- Individual random seeds for each agent ensure unique movement patterns

## Benchmarking and Stress Testing
- Added benchmarking functionality (B key) to add 10 random agents
- Added stress testing functionality (S key) to add 100 random agents at once
- Implemented performance metrics tracking with updates per second display
- Added visual performance indicator in SDL mode showing FPS
- Enhanced simulation to run indefinitely instead of limiting to specific steps
- Optimized console output for long-running simulations
- Added clean single-line status updates to reduce terminal clutter

## User Interface Improvements
- Implemented keyboard controls for all simulation features
- Added mouse-based agent placement
- Created status panel with simulation info
- Added visual cursor feedback in agent placement mode
- Implemented dynamic UI elements that reflect simulation state
- Reduced console output to maximize performance
- Added informative status line with simulation statistics
- Added final map printing at program exit

## Summary
The community simulation now features:
- Six agent types with unique behaviors: Settler, Explorer, Builder, Farmer, Miner, and Scout
- Random movement with unique patterns per agent based on individual seeds
- Five interaction types: Greeting, Trading, Collaboration, Teaching, and Resource
- Interactive controls via keyboard and mouse
- Performance benchmarking and stress testing capabilities
- Support for thousands of agents with multi-threaded processing
- Real-time performance metrics and statistics
- Dynamic terrain with procedurally generated features
- Dual visualization modes: ASCII terminal output and SDL3 graphical rendering
- Saving simulation state to file
- Configurable simulation speed and display options
- User-friendly interface with status indicators
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components

```zig
// Example of adding random agents for benchmarking
const addRandomAgents = struct {
    fn add(simulation: *Simulation, base_seed: u64, count: usize, width: usize, height: usize) !void {
        std.debug.print("Adding {d} random agents...\n", .{count});
        
        var i: usize = 0;
        while (i < count) : (i += 1) {
            const seed = base_seed +% i;
            const pos = getRandomPosition(width, height, seed);
            const agent_type = getRandomAgentType(seed);
            const health = @as(u8, 75) + @as(u8, @intCast(@mod(seed, 51))); // 75-125 range
            const energy = @as(u8, 75) + @as(u8, @intCast(@mod(seed >> 32, 51))); // 75-125 range
            
            try simulation.spawnAgent(.{
                .x = pos.x,
                .y = pos.y,
                .type = agent_type,
                .health = health,
                .energy = energy,
            });
        }
        
        std.debug.print("Added {d} random agents. Total agents: {d}\n", .{count, simulation.agents.items.len});
    }
}.add;
